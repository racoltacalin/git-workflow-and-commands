1. ### Create a New Repository

       * # Create a new Git repository in the current directory.
        $ git init
       * # Create a new directory and initialize it to the Git repository.
        $ git init [project-name]
       * # Download a project and its entire code history.
        $ git clone [url]

    Pros:

        * Each stage are clearly defined
        * Process and results are well documented.
        * Simple and easy to understand and use.
        * Easy to manage due to the rigidity of the model.
