1. ### Create a New Repository

       # Create a new Git repository in the current directory.
       $ git init
       
       # Create a new directory and initialize it to the Git repository.
       $ git init [project-name]
       
       # Download a project and its entire code history.
       $ git clone [url]

    The setting file for Git is .gitconfig, which can be placed under the user's home directory (global configuration) or under the project directory (project configuration).

       # Display the current Git configuration.
       $ git config --list
      
       # Edit Git Configuration File.
       $ git config -e [--global]
       
       # Set the user information when submitting code.
       $ git config [--global] user.name "[name]"
       $ git config [--global] user.email "[email address]"
